127000_DESC;The main army of the Latins, led by the traitors Alexios and Isaac Laskaris, have been ravaged by the armies of John III Doukas Vaztates on the fields of Mysia, and the pretenders captured and blinded. With this defeat, the Latin grip of Asia Minor loosens, and the road to Adrianople opens for the Nicaeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
127001_DESC;The once mighty Latin Empire that dared to contest the succession of John III has been enfeebled by our victories, and now have no choice but to accept our conquests. The Latins are willing to accept our conquests of Mysia, but will retain Nicomedia and make peace with our realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
127002_DESC;Despite our recognition of the Nicaean conquests, it seems our show of weakness has inspired the Nicaeans to march on Adrianople. They seem to have landed in order to block the Epirote advance, but their strategic position may spell the fall of Constantinople.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
127003_DESC;As our advance into Thrace continues, the pretender army of the Nicaeans has siezed the opportunity and stolen Adrianople for themselves. If we do nothing, our advance will be halted here and now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
127004_DESC;The Epirote army, under the leadership of the pretender Theodore Komnenos Doukas, has begun blockading our garrison in Adrianople. They will allow us to retreat unmolested if we surrender the city, but such a move will halt our ambitions in Thrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
127005_DESC;With the persistent advance of the Epirote army, even Constantinople is at risk of falling into Greek hands. The authority of the empire has crumbled, and our once loyal vassals are carving up their own states from our territory. Only God can save us now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
127006_DESC;Although the Latin Empire has been eroded of its strength, the mighty walls of Constantinople continue to remain in Latin hands. More worryingly, the Bulgarians under John Asen have been making ploys to control the Latin Empire for themselves. If we are to reclaim Constantinople, such a threat must not be ignored.;;
127007_DESC;The Latin Empire has suffered a string of defeats recently, and with the regency of the 11-year old Baldwin II, the Latins have entered into negotiations where John Asen can become regent of Baldwin in exchange for our support against the Epirotes. Such a position would allow us every opportunity to take over Constantinople ourselves.;;
127008_DESC;The death of Robert of Courtenay and the regency of Baldwin II have enfeebled the Latin court.;;
133024_DESC;Upon the arrival of Frederick II in Sicily after his Imperial coronation, he was determined to rebuild the authority of the Sicilian crown after years of regencies. The minority of Fredrick II had allowed the nobility to grab much of the Crown's power and domain, with its effective power did not extend far beyond Palermo. Immediately upon return, Frederick II enacted the Assizes of Capua in 1220, and later the Assizes of Messina in 1221, restoring the power of the Crown. The Assizes of Capua demanded the restoration of all royal lands and castles to the state they were at the death of William II, the last legitimate Norman king. All privileges accorded to anyone whatsoever since the end of William II's reign were ordered to submit for confirmation to the Royal Chancery, and present tenure of fiefs and their future control were regulated by the Emperor. The subsequent purge of any nobility who opposed the decrees saw the end of baronial resistance on the mainland and the power of the greater nobility utterly broken.;;
133000_DESC;The Sicilian territories inherited by Frederick II from his mother Constance of Sicily carried with them not only authority over the Roman Catholic majority of the island, but also over significant numbers of Greeks, Jews and Muslims. The Muslims of the regno were a heterogeneous community, that included Arabs, Berbers, Persians, and other groups, settled mostly in port towns and nearby villages, most notably in the province of Agrigento and a sizable number of local people who had converted to Islam during the Muslim rule in Sicily. Uncontent with Catholic rule, the terrain of Sicily favoured the resistance action of groups of Muslims, hoping to restore the dominion of Islam in what in Arabic had initially been called al-Ard al-Kabira. Some Muslim groups had found bases for resistance in central and western Sicily, around Iato and Entella. These rebels pose a great threat to the safety of the faithful in Sicily.;;
133001_DESC;With the defeat of the Muslim religious uprisings in Sicily, the threat to the Regno has been pacified, and many of the rebel notables have fled to North Africa. However, the question of what to do with the remaining Saracens hang in the air, and a threat of another rebellion is always looming. For now, though, Sicilian is free of rebellion.;;
133002_DESC;As a consequence of the Muslim uprisings, after most of the affluent and powerful Muslims had returned to North Africa, Frederick II determined to expel the remaining Muslims from Sicily, or at least the less docile groups amongst them, who constituted the essential remaining leadership of the Muslim community: the notables, the scholars and the warriors with their families. Fredrick II expelled all Muslims from the island and resettled them in the southern Italian mainland, transferring many to Lucera over the next two decades. In this controlled environment, they could not challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their vast numbers eventually led to Lucera being called Lucaera Saracenorum because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy.;;
133003_DESC;Following the disastrous Fifth Crusade, Frederick was blamed by both Pope Honorius III and the general Christian populace for this calamitous defeat. In 1225, after agreeing with Pope Honorius to launch a Crusade before 1228, Frederick made preparations for his expedition to the Holy land. After months of assembling an army in Brindisi, the Crusader army has finally departed for Acre.;;
